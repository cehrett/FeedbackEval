# Project Progress Checklist

This checklist guides the development of the Faculty Feedback Analysis project, from initial setup to final completion. Check off each task as you complete it to track your progress.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Set up project directory structure
- [x] Create and initialize essential files (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
- [x] Initialize Git repository and make the first commit
- [x] Verify that all placeholder files and directories are in place with initial comments

## 2. Data Analysis Module (`data_analysis`)

### 2.1 Compute Scores (Numerical Data)
- [x] Implement `compute_scores.py` function to calculate average scores for each faculty member
- [x] Add functionality to calculate standard deviation of scores

### 3.2 Rewrite Non-Actionable Feedback
- [ ] Implement function in `rewrite_feedback.py` to identify non-actionable feedback entries
- [ ] Set up LLM connection in `rewrite_feedback.py` to rewrite non-actionable feedback
- [ ] Store original and revised feedback entries for comparison
- [ ] Write tests in `tests/test_llm_analysis.py` for rewrite functionality (using mock responses)

- [ ] Define sections of the report: Numerical Scores, Text Variability, Actionability Scores, Recommendations
- [ ] Document the template structure and how to update it

### 4.2 Generate Reports
- [ ] Implement `generate_reports.py` to compile and format data for each faculty member
- [ ] Integrate `Jinja2` or equivalent library for report templating
- [ ] Generate sample reports using test data to verify report structure
- [ ] Write tests for report generation in `tests/test_report_generation.py`
- [ ] Document function purpose and parameters in `generate_reports.py`

## 5. Integration and Automation

### 5.1 Create Pipeline Scripts
- [ ] Implement `run_data_analysis.py` to execute data analysis module
- [ ] Implement `run_llm_analysis.py` to execute LLM analysis module
- [ ] Implement `run_report_generation.py` to execute report generation module
- [ ] Test each script individually to ensure they work as expected

### 5.2 Integrate Workflow in `main.py`
- [ ] Implement `main.py` to orchestrate the entire pipeline
- [ ] Test the full pipeline to verify smooth execution from start to finish
- [ ] Document the purpose and usage of `main.py`

---

## 6. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Write additional unit tests for edge cases across all modules
- [ ] Conduct integration tests to verify interactions between modules
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) to automate testing on each commit
- [ ] Perform validation of LLM outputs with sample data reviewed by experts
- [ ] Adjust scoring and rewriting functions based on validation feedback

---

## 7. Documentation and Finalization

- [ ] Update `README.md` with usage examples and instructions
- [ ] Add detailed descriptions to `docs/architecture.md` for each module and their interactions
- [ ] Write a usage guide in `docs/usage.md` with step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Ensure code documentation and comments are consistent and clear
- [ ] Review code and documentation for readability, consistency, and adherence to coding standards
- [ ] Perform a final test of the entire pipeline to ensure readiness for deployment

---

## 8. Future Enhancements (Optional)
